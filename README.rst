Dotfiles
========
This repository contains my dotfiles. It is not meant to clone and use as-is
but can be useful as reference/inspiration.

I use these files with several OSes and \*NIX flavours (Ubuntu, RHEL, Solaris
and Cygwin on Windows 10) so I tend to have my own stuff, set of aliases,
profile.d directory in my $HOME, etc. rather than rely on distribution ones.

If you have any questions or comments, drop me a message here on Github, send
me an e-mail or tweet (@blami).

Happy hacking!
