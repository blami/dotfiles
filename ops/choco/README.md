# Choco

This is my personal Chocolatey package collection I use mostly from Ansible to
install (and update) software that I use on Windows.

See `ops/ansible/_common/tasks/win_choco_sources.yml`.

**DISCLAIMER: packages are very opinionated (e.g. installation directories or
components being installed) and only for my personal use.**

## Notes

* Version `0.0` means that package points to **latest** version URL. This also
  usually means that software updates itself.
