# Choco

This is my personal Chocolatey package collection I use mostly from Ansible to
install (and update) software for Windows.

## Disclaimer

Please note that these packages are very opinionated (e.g. installation
directories or components being installed) and only for my personal use.

## Notes

* Version `0.0` means that package points to **latest** version URL. This also
  usually means that software updates itself.
