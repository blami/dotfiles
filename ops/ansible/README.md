# Ansible

This is my personal playbook to set-up **workstations** and **homelab**
devices. Similarly to rest of my dotfiles it is probably no-use as is but might
be useful for copying out some bits or getting some inspiration.

NOTE: I am not an Ansible expert; but rather self (not much) educated user so
things I do here might be a bit fishy.


## Usage

```shell
$ ansible-playbook [-K] play.yml
```
