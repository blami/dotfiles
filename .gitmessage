# <type>[<scope>][!]: Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary
#
# More detailed explanatory text. Wrap it to about 72 characters. In
# some contexts, the first line is treated as the subject of an email
# and the rest of the text as the body.
#
# Tokens <type>, <scope> and ! in title are from Conventional Commits
# (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
#
# Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
# bug" or "Fixes bug."
#
# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
#
# * Bullet points are okay, too
#
# * Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
# single space, with blank lines in between.
#
# Trailer: These lines are trailers (see: git-interpret-trailers(1)) and
#   have <token>: <value> format. The <value> may be split over multiple
#   lines with each line starting with at least one whitespace.
# Resolves: #123
