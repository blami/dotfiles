Dotfiles
========
This repository contains my ~ dotfiles. It is not meant to clone and use as-is
but can be useful as an inspiration in some cases.

Mostly I use this on several Debian/Ubuntu machines, but also on Solaris 11+
boxes at work and in Cygwin environment on my Microsoft Windows 10 machine.

I usually clone whole repository to ~/dotfiles and then copy over. To manage I
use my own alias dfgit which sets --git-dir to .dfgit to not interfere with
shell plugins for real-git repos, IDEs, etc.

If you have any questions or comments, you're welcome to leave message here on
BitBucket/Github or send me an e-mail or on Twitter @blami.

Happy hacking!
